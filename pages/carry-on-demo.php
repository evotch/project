              <p>The following baggage rules apply only when traveling with us on Alaska Airlines. If your itinerary includes travel on another airline, please check that airline's website for their specific baggage rules.</p>
              <p>You're allowed one carry-on bag, which <em>including wheels and handles</em> can measure up to 24 inches in length x 17 inches in width x 10 inches in height (61 x 43 x 25 cm), plus one personal item, such as a purse, briefcase or laptop computer. At least one of the items should be stowed under the seat in front of you, and you'll also need to be able to lift your own bag into the overhead bin.</p>
              <p>Every effort will be made to accommodate your carry-on in the passenger cabin. Acceptance of carry-on baggage is subject to space availability on the aircraft at the time you board. In the event adequate space is not available, your carry-on bag will be checked for no charge to baggage claim at your final destination. </p>
              <p>Items exceeding the free carry-on allowance will be charged $25 per piece and tagged for delivery to baggage claim at your destination.</p>
              <h4>I.D. Tag for the Inside of Your Bag</h4>
              <p>Please download the tag below, fill out the information, then place it inside your bag. In the case of a misplaced bag, this tag can help expedite the identification and return process.</p>

                <h3>Measuring your bags</h3>
                <p>Measure the distnace from the floor to the highest point on the top of the bag (typically the handle.)  Then, measure the width of the bag from side-to-side when looking at it from th efront. Last, measure the thickness of the bag when looking at it from the side. The sum of these equals the total linear inches.</p>

              <div class="col-sm-8">
                <p>Because of smaller overhead storage and under seat space on aircraft operated by <i>Horizon Air</i> or <i>SkyWest</i> (Bombardier Q400 or CRJ aircraft), larger carry-on items will be placed on a planeside cart before boarding. These items will be specially tagged and returned to the cart for retrieval at a designated area on the ramp or jet bridge as you get off of your flight. Just find the red and white stop sign and your bags will be there within 5 minutes of deplaning. Fragile or high-value items should be carried into the cabin with you and not left on the planeside cart.</p>
                <p>The maximum dimensions for an à la cart bag is 10" H x 17" W x 24" L (25 x 43 x 61 cm) including wheels and handles.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some items allowed in carry-on baggage cannot travel in the checked baggage compartment. The item MUST remain with you in the cabin or be removed before your carry-on bag is placed on the à la cart or given to an employee at the gate or onboard to place in the checked baggage compartment. Refer to the Prohibited Items section below for more information.</p>
