<h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4>
<p>When using footnotes to reference and expand on information within content, please use the following structure:</p>
<div class="callout callout-blue">
		<p>Always use asterisks following price points</p>
<p>Always use asterisks when footnoting to the Terms and Conditions of a Promotion</p>
<p>For policy information, you may use asterisks if there are two or fewer items to footnote on the page, otherwise use superscript numbers. </p>
<p>Banks and credit card companies will use the dagger &dagger; symbol to make foot notes. We donâ€™t use this for our copy, but we do allow them to use it on our site and emails.</p>
</div>
