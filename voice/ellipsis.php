<h4 id="ellipsis">Ellipsis ( <span class="secondary">&amp;hellip;</span>)</h4>
<p>A series of three spaced periods with spaces before and after is an ellipsis. It should be used to indicate omitted material within a quoted sentence, to represent a pause in dialog, or to connect a series of loosely related phrases. Note: Spacing can be adjusted for design considerations but the series should be no more than and no fewer than 3 periods.</p>
