<h4 id="quotation-marks">Quotation marks</h4>
<p>Use straight quotes rather than smart or curly quotes in code. </p>
<h4 class="secondary">Punctuation with</h4>
<p>When deciding if a period should be inside or outside of parentheses or quotation marks, refer to the <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html">Chicago Manual of Style</a>. Here’s a summary of that section:</p>
<p><i>Periods and commas precede closing quotation marks, whether double or single. Colons and semicolons – unlike periods and commas – follow closing quotation marks; question marks and exclamation points following closing quotation marks unless they belong within the quoted matter.</i></p>
<p>For questions on exclamation points, question marks, and other marks of punctuation, feel free to email Jean Carlon (ext. 22156).</p>
