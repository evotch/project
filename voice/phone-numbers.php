<h4 id="phone-numbers">Phone numbers</h4>
<h4 class="secondary">Text and labels</h4>
<p>We use "Phone" or "phone." Avoid using "Telephone" or "telephone."</p>
<h4 class="secondary">Domestic</h4>
<p>Include 10 digits. Separate using dashes. 206-901-5555</p>
<h4 class="secondary">International</h4>
<p>Length will vary. Follow the structure of separation by using dashes. 1-77-017-33452</p>
<h4 class="secondary">1-800-ALASKAAIR</h4>
<p>For promotional type pages use: 1-800-ALASKAAIR followed by the reminder # in parenthesis:<br>
1-800-ALASKAAIR (1-800-252-7522) The snippets for this are AS_RES_PHONE and AS_RES_REMINDER_PHONE, used one after the other.<br>
For any other pages, especially policy related ones, do not display 1-800-ALASKAAIR. Use AS_RES_DIGITS for just 1-800-252-7522.
</p>
<h4 class="secondary">TTY/relay</h4>
<p>TTY/relay services should be mentioned on the following Contact Us pages: Reservations, Customer Care, Hotel and Car, Vacations, and Lost Baggage sections in the Contact Us part of the site, we will display: Hearing & Speech Impaired (TTY): Dial 711 for relay services. This is the only part of the site on which this number displays, with the exception being the hearing impaired page.</p>
<h4 class="secondary">Error messages</h4>
<p>Phone numbers should be used in error messages when the error blocks the customer from continuing or if they continue to see it, they may need to call. Generally, the number displayed should be for Reservations, with the exception being calls related to My Account/Mileage Plan, or other specific areas (i.e. Cargo, but excluding Partner Award desk â€“ phone tree now handles that differentiation). </p>
