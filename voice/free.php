<p>"Free" may not be used standing alone to describe flights. Rather, we will only be able to use "Free of Carrier Charges" or "Without Carrier Charges" in the body of the advertisement, per the DOT. This ruling only applies in context to free flights. Free hotel night stays or Free Ski lift tickets are fine to use as is.</p>
