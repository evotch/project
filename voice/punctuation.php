<h4 id="punctuation">Punctuation</h4>
<p>All grammatical and punctuation questions will be determined by the Chicago Manual of Style. Exceptions are made for social media restrictions and design considerations. 
<br>When deciding if a period should be inside or outside of parentheses or quotation marks, refer to the Chicago Manual of Style. Here’s a summary of that section:
<br>
<i>Periods and commas precede closing quotation marks, whether double or single. Colons and semicolons – unlike periods and commas – follow closing quotation marks; question marks and exclamation points following closing quotation marks unless they belong within the quoted matter.</i>
<p>Also:</p>
<i>When an entire independent sentence is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets, the period belongs inside the closing parenthesis or bracket. When matter in parentheses or brackets, even a grammatically complete sentence, is included within another sentence, the period belongs outside. Avoid enclosing more than one complete sentence within another sentence.</i>

<h4 class="secondary">Oxford comma</h4>
<div class="callout callout-green">
	<p>We DO USE the Oxford comma in all digital marketing channels. Exceptions are made for social media restrictions and design considerations.</p>
</div>
<p>Items in a series are normally separated by commas. When a conjunction joins the last two elements in a series of three or more, a comma—known as the serial or series comma or the Oxford comma&mdash;should appear before the conjunction. At Alaskaair.com we strongly recommend this usage, since it prevents ambiguity. If the last element consists of a pair joined by and, the pair should still be preceded by a serial comma and the first and (see the last example below).</p>
<div class="callout callout-green">
	<p>I want no ifs, ands, or buts.<br>
Paul put the kettle on, Don fetched the teapot, and I made tea.<br>
John was singing, Jean was playing guitar, and Alan was running errands and furnishing food.<br>
</p>
</div>
<p>We basically never use exclamation points on alaskaair.com. If it is necessary for some reason, never use more than one exclamation point at the end of a sentence and keep their use to an absolute minimum (only one per page if ever used). For questions on exclamation points, question marks, and other marks of punctuation, feel free to email Jean Carlon (ext. 22156).</p>
