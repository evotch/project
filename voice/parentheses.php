<h4 id="parentheses">Parentheses</h4>
<p>When an entire independent sentence is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets, the period belongs inside the closing parenthesis or bracket. When matter in parentheses or brackets, even a grammatically complete sentence, is included within another sentence, the period belongs outside. Avoid enclosing more than one complete sentence within another sentence.</p>
