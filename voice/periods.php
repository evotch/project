<i>
When deciding if a period should be inside or outside of parentheses or quotation marks, refer to the Chicago Manual of Style. Here’s a summary of that section:
Periods and commas precede closing quotation marks, whether double or single. Colons and semicolons – unlike periods and commas – follow closing quotation marks; question marks and exclamation points following closing quotation marks unless they belong within the quoted matter.</i><br>
Also:<br>
<i>When an entire independent sentence is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets, the period belongs inside the closing parenthesis or bracket. When matter in parentheses or brackets, even a grammatically complete sentence, is included within another sentence, the period belongs outside. Avoid enclosing more than one complete sentence within another sentence.</i><br><br>

	<h4>In layout (tables, pull-down menus, form elements).</h4>
	<p>Do not use periods in abbreviations. Example: 10 am or Mon, Aug 17<br>
	Note: a series of three spaced periods with spaces before and after is an ellipsis. See <a href="#ellipsis">ellipsis</a>.
