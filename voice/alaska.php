<h4 id="alaskaair">Alaska vs Alaska Airlines</h4>
<p>The primary brand use will be "Alaska" by itself. However, digital channels will often require the inclusion of the word Airlines to clarify the brand communication, aid with digital advertising, and help with search engine optimization. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that there is context. If there is airplane imagery, "Alaska" will be fine. If all of the photography is location based it is important to be clear about being an airline by including it in the copy, as opposed to the wordmark.
<ul>
<li>On webpages it will be useful to use the full "Alaska Airlines" the first time it is mentioned in the body copy. After that, use only "Alaska".</li>
<li>Email may use "Alaska" by itself under all circumstances. The full name appears in the email address and that is considered the first mention. </li>
<li>Social can rely on the recognition of the social media accounts, using either "Alaska" or "Alaska Airlines" at their own discretion. </li>
<li>Online advertising will need the full "Alaska Airlines" unless there is airplane imagery in the ad. </li>
