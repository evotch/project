            <h3 id="type-headings">Headings</h3>
            <p>All HTML headings, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> through <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, are available. <code>.h1</code> through <code>.h6</code> classes are also available, for when you want to match the font styling of a heading but still want your text to be displayed inline.  When two headings are used the second heading can use the light font by adding the class <code>.secondary</code></p>
